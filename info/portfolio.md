Computer Engineering
Student
During my computer engineering education, I strive to work in areas that are in line

with my ideals, that will make me happy in my professional life and that will enable

me to do my job with love. By applying what I have learned in projects, I aim to

increase both my technical competence and my ability to develop creative

solutions. As the chairman of the board of directors of the Yazılım, Yapay Zeka ve

Yaratıcılık (3Y) Community at our school, I am responsible for implementing large

organisations. Believing wholeheartedly in the philosophy of "There is always an

environment to rise; if not, it can be created", I focus on creating new opportunities

in every challenge I face and focus on continuous development with my team. I am

proud to take part in every organisation and project that will benefit our country; I

aim to make my knowledge and experience useful in this direction. At the point

where technical knowledge and creative thinking come together, I carry out my

most productive work. In my free time, I nurture my passion for writing poetry and

songs, and I love to express myself with the power of words and melodies. By

blending art and engineering, I contribute to both my projects and my personal

development.

You can access my poems here and listen to the song, whose lyrics I wrote and my

friend sang, here. (My domain has expired, so it is currently closed.)

SCHOLARSHIP

RECIPIENT (2022-

PRESENT

As a recipient of the Özdemir Bayraktar National Technology Scholarship, I
serve as an educator and mentor within the T3 Foundation's Instructor-Mentor
Scholarship Program. This prestigious national scholarship program, launched
by the Türkiye Technology Team Foundation, supports students contributing
to Turkey's National Technology Initiative and emphasizes collective learning
and social responsibility.
In this capacity, I mentor over 50 high school students in STEM-oriented

projects, guiding them in developing problem-solving and analytical

thinking skills. The program aims to nurture young individuals who are

responsible, open to teamwork, and eager to discover their potential while
actively participating in Turkey's technological advancement.

DEVFEST 2025/
DECEMBER 6, 2025
As Chairman of the Board of Directors at Akdeniz University

Software, AI and Creativity Community (3Y), I co-organized DevFest

Antalya 2025 in collaboration with GDG (Google Developer Groups)

Antalya. This premier technology event brought together

developers, tech enthusiasts, and industry professionals for a full-day

conference at Akdeniz University Atatürk Conference Hall.

BİLMÖK 2025/
FEBRUARY 2025
As the Yazılım,Yapay Zeka ve Yaratıcılık Topluluğu, of

which I am the Chairman of the Board of Directors, we

were proud to successfully host BİLMÖK 2025, Turkey's

largest student congress.

During the two-day event, we organised comprehensive

sessions in current and critical areas such as artificial

intelligence, cyber security, software development and

technology ethics. We hosted important discussions on

the future of the IT world by coming together with the

leading experts of the sector and brought together more

than a thousand IT passionate students from across the

country.

AI-Powered RAG System for
API Documentation / July
2025
D eveloped a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that
enables developers to query API documentation using natural

language. The system indexes technical documents, embeds them

into a vector database, and retrieves the most relevant context

during inference. Using LangChain and Pinecone for retrieval and
FastAPI for backend orchestration, the application delivers

accurate and real-time responses to documentation-related

queries.

The web interface provides a user-friendly environment where
developers can search API functions, parameters, and usage

examples without manually browsing the documentation. This

significantly reduces onboarding time, improves developer

productivity, and enhances accessibility to complex technical
resources.

Using Soil and Temperature Sensors Determining the Water Requirement
of Crops in the Soil with Agrotopia
This project, of which I am the project coordinator, is an artificial
intelligence-supported smart irrigation solution developed to increase
water efficiency in agriculture and to meet the water needs of plants at an
optimum level. Using a Raspberry Pi based system with soil moisture and
temperature sensors, a special classification has been created for the
plants in the field. Thanks to this classification, the ideal amount of
irrigation is determined according to the plant type and water waste is
prevented. This project will also ensure sustainability. The artificial
intelligence model called Agrotopia analyses the data, predicts the water
needs of each plant and instantly transmits it to farmers via the mobile
application. This system, which is currently under construction, aims to
offer a sustainable future in agricultural production. You can go to the web
page of our project here.
E-Commerce Platform with

Angular, Spring Boot & MySQL
I developed a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce platform built
with Angular, Spring Boot, and MySQL, designed to provide a
scalable, modular, and production-oriented shopping experience.
On the backend, I implemented a layered architecture with clean
separation between controllers, services, and repositories, enabling
efficient product management, order processing, user
authentication, and secure role-based access control. The database
schema was designed from scratch to support relational
consistency across products, carts, orders, payments, and user
profiles, using JPA/Hibernate with optimized queries and indexing
for high-performance data retrieval. The frontend, built with
Angular and TypeScript, features a fully responsive interface,
dynamic product pages, asynchronous data fetching, and a state-
managed shopping cart to ensure a smooth and intuitive user flow.
One of the most impactful features of the platform is the AI-
powered recommendation module, which analyzes user behavior,
browsing patterns, and product metadata to deliver adaptive and
personalized product suggestions, significantly enhancing user
engagement. Together, these components form a robust and
extensible e-commerce system that demonstrates my capabilities
in software architecture, full-stack development, API design,
database engineering, and integrating intelligent features into real-
world applications.

AI-Powered Lyrics
Synchronization Player
I built an AI-powered lyrics synchronization player that automatically
aligns song lyrics with audio using Python, OpenAI Whisper, and the VLC
media player API. The system processes the audio in real time, extracts
speech segments with Whisper, and matches them to the lyrics through
intelligent timing and fuzzy text alignment. The application generates
accurate timestamps, highlights the currently sung line, and provides
smooth playback control through VLC integration. This project showcases
my ability to combine AI models, audio processing, and real-time
application logic into a functional and user-friendly desktop tool.

Combinatorial Article on

Fibonacci and Catalan Paths /

DECEMBER 2025
In the field of computer science and combinatorial mathematics,
our academic work "Fibonacci and Catalan Paths: A Combinatorial
Study in Lattice Walls" investigates the mathematical properties of
lattice paths involving Fibonacci, Catalan and Motzkin numbers.
This paper presents numerical and structural analyses of
constrained lattice paths using Python-based algorithms and
visualisation techniques. In this paper, the theoretical framework of
these paths is elaborated through generating functions, kernel
methods and combinatorial transformations. The research provides
new perspectives in the fields of discrete mathematics and
algorithmic design by revealing the relationship between wall-
bounded paths and classical number sequences. 📄 To access the
full paper: GitHub Repo In the process of this work, I had the
opportunity to further develop my academic research competence
by contributing in the areas of methodology, analysis,
programming and visualisation.
